# Security Policy - phenoUtils

## 1. Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| latest  | :white_check_mark: |
| < latest| :x:                |

Only the latest tagged release receives security updates. Older versions are not patched; please upgrade.

## 2. Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in `phenoUtils`, please report it privately:

- **Email:** kooshapari@kooshapari.com
- **GitHub:** Open a private security advisory via the Security tab on this repository
- **DO NOT** open a public issue, PR, or discussion for security vulnerabilities
- **DO NOT** disclose the vulnerability publicly until we have issued a fix and an advisory

We aim to acknowledge new reports within **3 business days** and to issue a fix or mitigation within **30 days** for critical issues.

## 3. Vulnerability Disclosure Process

1. **Report received** - maintainer acknowledges and assigns a CVE-style tracking ID.
2. **Triage** - severity assessed (Critical / High / Medium / Low) using CVSS 3.1.
3. **Patch development** - fix authored in a private fork; CI validates the fix.
4. **Coordinated disclosure** - embargo window negotiated (default 90 days from report).
5. **Public advisory** - GitHub Security Advisory + CVE assignment + release notes.

## 4. Security Update Cadence

- **Critical / High:** patch release within 7 days; GHSA published simultaneously
- **Medium:** patch release within 30 days
- **Low:** bundled into next regular release

Cadence is codified in ADR-042 (security audit cadence, monthly sweep via `scripts/audit.sh`).

## 5. Scope

In scope:
- The `phenoUtils` source tree on the default branch
- Tagged releases on the default branch
- Pre-built artifacts published from CI (crates.io / PyPI / npm / Go modules)

Out of scope:
- Issues in transitive dependencies (report upstream)
- Issues requiring physical access to the user's machine
- Denial-of-service via resource exhaustion in user-supplied inputs (best-effort mitigation only)

## 6. Security Tooling

This repository runs the following security tooling on every push and weekly cron:

- `cargo audit` / `pip-audit` / `npm audit` / `govulncheck` - dependency CVE scanning
- `gitleaks` - secret detection (`.gitleaks.toml` allowlists known false positives)
- `trivy` - image and filesystem vulnerability scanning
- `cargo-cyclonedx` / `syft` - SBOM generation (CycloneDX format)
- `slsa-github-generator` - SLSA Build Level 3 provenance attestation
- CodeQL - static analysis for the primary language

See `.github/workflows/security.yml` and `scripts/audit.sh` for full configuration.

## 7. Dependencies and Supply Chain

- All dependencies pinned via lockfile (Cargo.lock / poetry.lock / package-lock.json / go.sum)
- `dependabot.yml` configured for security-only updates (see `.github/dependabot.yml`)
- Renovate is not used
- SBOMs are generated on every release and attached to the GitHub release

## 8. Acknowledgements

We thank the security researchers and contributors who report vulnerabilities responsibly.
