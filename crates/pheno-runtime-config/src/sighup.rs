//! SIGHUP-based reload fallback.
//!
//! For environments without filesystem notifications (some sandboxes, CI
//! runners), this module provides a manual nudge: call `reload()` on any
//! `Reloadable<T>` by sending a SIGHUP signal to the process. The handler
//! is registered once at startup and delegates to a user-provided reload
//! closure.
